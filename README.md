# Project-8
 Store Inventory App

The goal was to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products including information about price, available stock, supplier details, and product image. It will also need to allow the user to adjust product stock.

Used SQLite database for storing information. Integrated Android’s file storage systems and used Content Provider to access the repository of data.
